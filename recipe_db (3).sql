Because of the lightness of the sauce and how the pork patties sit in the sauce, the sauce is often referred to as broth.\r\nPickled vegetables: Bún Chả Hà Nội typically uses pickled papaya. Whereas Bún Thịt Nướng typically uses pickled daikon and carrot.\r\nPork: The pork used in Bún Chả Hà Nội is typically ground pork made into patties, while the pork used in Bún Thịt Nướng is typically thinly sliced pork shoulder/butt.\r\nHow to Make It\r\nStep 1: Season the pork\r\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine ground pork, fish sauce, oyster sauce, brown sugar, ground black pepper, roasted rice powder, MSG, lemongrass, garlic, and shallots.\r\nground pork mixture for bun cha\r\nStep 2: Make patties and grill\r\nTo prevent the ground pork mixture from sticking to your hands, oil them with vegetable oil. Roll the mixture into 32 small patties. Grill the patties over charcoal fire for a more authentic taste, about 8 minutes per side or until lightly charred. \r\nI\'m using a metal wire grilling basket, which is a common sight in Vietnam when grilling over charcoal. It\'s not essential if you have a grill, but it can be a helpful tool for smaller foods that can fall through the grill grates. It also produces beautiful, thin grill marks and makes it easy to flip food in one go.\r\nYou can also pan-fry the patties on high heat on the stovetop or air-fry them at 350°F, about 5 minutes per side.\r\nbun cha meatballs assembled for the grill\r\nmetal wire basket with bun cha pork patties ready to be grilled\r\nStep 3: Make the quick pickled papaya\r\nIn a medium bowl, combine sliced papaya and salt.

Make sure the stem is intact.\r\nCutting up cabbage for kimchi:-\r\n2) Dissolve the coarse salt in the water (16 cups) in a large bowl. Dip the napa cabbage in the saltwater one at a time and transfer it onto a tray for further salting.\r\nDissolving salt in water and salting cabbage for kimchi:=\r\nPinch some cooking salt (1/2 cup total for all pickled cabbages) and rub over the thick white part of the cabbage. Open each leaf gently and sprinkle the salt over the thick white part. Repeat this for the rest of the cabbage. Reserve the saltwater from when you soaked the cabbage for later use.\r\nSalting cabbage for kimchi:-\r\n3) Put the salted cabbage in a large food grade plastic bag or large bucket (wedge side of the cabbage to be facing up) and pour in the reserved saltwater from step 2. Close the plastic bag. If using a bucket, get something heavy on top of the cabbage to press down (e.g heavy pot with water).\r\nPickling cabbage for kimchi in a large food-grade bag:-\r\nSet the cabbage aside for 6 hours to pickle. Rotate the cabbage upside down every 2 hours. Using a large food grade plastic bag will make the turning process much easier than using a large bucket.\r\nChecking pickled cabbage for kimchi:-\r\n4) Once the soaking process is finished, rinse the cabbages in running water, especially the thick white part of the cabbage, to get rid of the salt. Place them in a colander and allow to drain for 1 hour.\r\nDraining cabbage in a colander:-\r\n5) While waiting, prepare the glutinous rice paste. Mix glutinous rice flour with the water (1.5 cups) in a saucepan and boil it over medium heat for 5-8 minutes, until it thickens. Once ready, transfer the rice paste to the medium-size bowl and let it cool. Add Korean chili flakes once it has cooled. Then, combine them well.\r\nMaking rice porridge for kimchi:-\r\n6) Prepare a large mixing bowl and add radish, fine sea salt, Korean fish sauce, and salted fermented shrimp. Leave it for 10 minutes for the radish to salt down. Add Korean chives, carrots, minced garlic, minced ginger, sugar, blended onion, and the Korean chili flakes mixture from step 5. Mix them well. Now the kimchi seasoning / kimchi paste is made, ready for use.\r\nMaking kimchi paste (kimchi seasoning):-\r\n7) Place a quarter of a cabbage on a tray. Spread the seasonings over each leaf. (You only need to season one side of the leaf.) 1 to 2 small fistfuls of seasoning is enough per quarter of cabbage. Repeat this step for the rest of the cabbage. Don’t pull the cabbage leaves off the stem, leave them attached so it holds together better.\r\nPutting kimchi seasoning on cabbage:-\r\n8) Transfer the kimchi into a kimchi container or an airtight container (and put the lid on). Leave it out at room temperature for 24 hours, then move it to the refrigerator. While you can start eating it once it’s chilled, you may want to wait 3-4 more days for it to develop more flavor.', 'k1.jpg', 'https://youtu.be/eTucCw1w6Ak?si=Zwr8j7lYH54SvXWz'),

The dough should be smooth and sticky but should not stick to the sides of the bowl, only a little to the bottom.\r\n4)NOTE - If the dough sticks to the sides sprinkle in a little more flour, if it is too dry then add a bit more water. This will vary every time you make it so keep extra flour handy.\r\n5)After the 8 minutes have passed remove the dough from the mixer and cut it into 6 pieces and form them into rounds. Place them on a lightly oiled cookie sheet and drizzle with 1 tbs or so of extra virgin olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to sit at room temperature and rise for 2 hours in a draft free area, I prefer the cold oven.

Using your fists and knuckles start stretching the dough until 10\" in diameter making sure not to tear it ( this should be easy since it is a small pie).\r\n7)Dust your pizza peel (or a piece of cardboard) very well with semolina flour or corn meal and set your pizza dough on it making sure it slides easily when moved. Pour 2-3 tablespoons of the pizza sauce in the center and spread it around with the back of a spoon leaving 1 inch of space at the edges and making sure not to get any on the peel.

Put the chicken and the Marinade ingredients into a ziplock bag or a bowl.\r\n2)Massage the bag well ensuring that all pieces are coated with the marinade. Marinate for 30 minutes to an hour.\r\n3)Heat enough oil in a deep pot or pan to 160°C/320°F (note 3). The depth of the oil should be about 3-4cm/1¼-1½”.\r\n4)Meanwhile, drain excess marinade from the chicken, place the chicken pieces on paper towels to remove excess liquid, and put them in a bowl.\r\n5)Sprinkle over the corn flour and turn chicken to coat every piece with corn flour.\r\n6)Fry chicken in batches. Add several chicken pieces to the oil one by one and fry for about 2.5-3 minutes (note 4). You may want to move the chicken pieces around as they tend to stick to the bottom of the pot/pan.\r\n7)Take the chicken pieces out of the oil and rest for at least 3-4 minutes (note 5) on paper towels. Repeat with remaining chicken pieces.\r\n8)Skim any flour crumbs from the oil if there are any and increase the temperature of the oil to 190-200°C/374-392°F (note 3).\r\n9)Put the chicken pieces back into the oil in batches and fry for about 30 seconds to 1 minute until golden brown and crunchy. Repeat with remaining chicken pieces.\r\n10)Serve immediately with shredded lettuce and parsley for decoration if using.\r\nRecipe Notes:-\r\n1) I cut the chicken thigh into about 5 x 4cm/2 x 1.6\". You can make it smaller or slightly larger. Then cooking time would need to be adjusted.\r\n2) Sugar can be substituted for miring. The sweetness of sugar vs mirin is 2:1 so use 1/4 teaspoon of sugar. Make sure you mix the marinade well to dissolve.\r\n3) I don\'t normally use a thermometer to check the temperature of the oil. I dip a pair of bamboo chopsticks in the oil and check the approximate temperature. If tiny bubbles are quietly forming around the chopsticks, then it is about 160-165°C/320-329°F, if larger bubbles are quickly rising, it is 180-190°C/356-374°F.\r\n4) To maintain the temperature of the oil, do not overcrowd the oil with too many chicken pieces. I used a 20cm/8\" pot and deep fried in 2 batches with no more than 5-6 chicken pieces at once.\r\n5) While resting, the chicken continues to cook slowly resulting in tender juicy chicken.\r\n6) If you are making a large amount of Karaage Chicken, hold the fried chicken in the oven. Before frying the chicken, turn the oven on to around 80-100°C (176-212°F). As you finish frying the chicken pieces for the second time, keep them on the tray in the oven while you fry the others.\r\n7) Nutrition information assumes that the vegetable oil absorbed into the fried chicken is about 8% of the weight of the chicken.

(15, 'Croissant ', 'france', 'Ingredients:-\r\n1)1/4 cup (4 Tablespoons; 60g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature\r\n2)4 cups (500g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled), plus more for rolling/shaping\r\n3)1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar\r\n4)2 teaspoons salt\r\n5)1 Tablespoon active dry or instant yeast\r\n6)1 and 1/2 cups (360ml) cold whole milk\r\nButter Layer:-\r\n7)1 and 1/2 cups (3 sticks; 345g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature\r\n8)2 Tablespoons (16g) all-purpose flour\r\nEgg Wash:-\r\n1)1 large egg\r\n2)2 Tablespoons (30ml) whole milk\r\n3)Cook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark\r\nInstructions:-\r\n1)Preliminary notes: Watch the video below and use the step-by-step photos before you begin. Read the recipe before beginning. Make room in the refrigerator for a baking sheet. In step 6 and again in step 13, you will need room for 2 baking sheets.\r\n2)Make the dough: Cut the butter in four 1-Tablespoon pieces and place in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment (or you can use a handheld mixer or no mixer, but a stand mixer is ideal). Add the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast. Turn the mixer on low-medium speed to gently combine the ingredients for 1 minute. With the mixer running, slowly pour in the milk. Once all of the milk is added, turn the mixer up to medium speed and beat the dough for at least 5 full minutes. (If you don’t have a mixer, knead by hand for 5 minutes.) The dough will be soft. It will (mostly) pull away from the sides of the bowl and if you poke it with your finger, it will bounce back. If after 5 minutes the dough is too sticky, keep the mixer running until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl.\r\n3)Remove dough from the bowl and, with floured hands, work it into a ball. Place the dough on a lightly floured silicone baking mat lined, lightly floured parchment paper lined, or lightly floured baking sheet. (I highly recommend a silicone baking mat because you can roll the dough out in the next step directly on top and it won’t slide all over the counter.) Gently flatten the dough out, as I do in the video below, and cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.\r\n4)Shape the dough: Remove the dough from the refrigerator. I like to keep the dough on the silicone baking mat when I’m rolling it in this step because the mat is nonstick and it’s a handy guide for the exact measurement. Begin flattening out the dough with your hands. You’re rolling it out into a rectangle in this step, so shaping it with your hands first helps the stretchy dough. Roll it into a 14×10-inch rectangle. The dough isn’t extremely cold after only 30 minutes in the refrigerator, so it will feel more like soft play-doh. Be precise with the measurement. The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working the edges with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle.\r\n5)Long rest: Place the rolled out dough back onto the baking sheet (this is why I prefer a silicone baking mat or parchment because you can easily transfer the dough). Cover the rolled out dough with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the refrigerator for 4 hours or overnight. (Up to 24 hours is ok.)\r\n6)Butter layer (begin this 35 minutes before the next step so the butter can chill for 30 minutes): In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and flour together until smooth and combined. Transfer the mixture to a silicone baking mat lined or parchment paper lined baking sheet. (Silicone baking mat is preferred because you can easily peel the butter off in the next step.) Using a spoon or small spatula, smooth out into a 7×10-inch rectangle. Be as precise as you can with this measurement. Place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and chill the butter layer for 30 minutes. (No need to cover it for only 30 minutes.) You want the butter layer firm, but still pliable. If it gets too firm, let it sit out on the counter for a few minutes to gently soften. The more firm the butter layer is the more difficult it will be to laminate the dough in the next step.\r\n7)Laminate the dough: In this next step, you will be rolling out the dough into a large rectangle. Do this on a lightly floured counter instead of rolling out on your silicone baking mat. The counter is typically a little cooler (great for keeping the dough cold) and the silicone baking mat is smaller than the measurement you need. Remove both the dough and butter layers from the refrigerator. Place the butter layer in the center of the dough and fold each end of the dough over it. If the butter wasn’t an exact 7×10-inch rectangle, use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to even out the edges. Seal the dough edges over the butter layer as best you can with your fingers. On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough into a 10×20-inch rectangle. It’s best to roll back and forth with the shorter end of the dough facing you, like I do in the video below. Use your fingers if you need to. The dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm muscle to roll. Again, the dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. This was the 1st turn.\r\n8)If the dough is now too warm to work with, place folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 2nd turn. I usually don’t have to.\r\n9)2nd turn: Turn the dough so the short end is facing you. Roll the dough out once again into a 10×20-inch rectangle, then fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. The dough must be refrigerated between the 2nd and 3rd turn because it has been worked with a lot by this point. Place the folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 3rd turn.\r\n10)3rd turn: Roll the dough out once again into a 10×20-inch rectangle.

Bring to a boil on high heat and then lower to medium and cook for about 25-30 minutes or until pork juices run clear when poked at the thickest part, or it registers 145 F with an instant read thermometer at the thickest part.\r\n2)Cover the pork in a bowl as it cools so it doesn\'t darken. Once cool, slice the pork as thinly as you can to make rolling easier later.\r\nCOOKING SHRIMP:-\r\n1)Defrost shrimp in water bowl. Once defrosted, de-vein the shrimp. Hold a shrimp up to a light to locate the vein, pierce the whiter part (joint) of the shrimp just below the vein with a toothpick, and pull the toothpick upwards towards the shrimp back. Do this slowly to remove the vein. Piece again at another joint if the vein breaks to remove all traces of vein. Repeat with all your shrimp.\r\n2)Cook the shrimp: add shrimp, salt, and enough water in a small pot to barely cover your shrimp. Boil on medium-high heat for only about 1.5 to 2.5 minutes or until the shrimp is no longer translucent.

Soak the rice paper just enough so that it is pliable and easy to handle, but remove the sheet before it gets too soft and sticky. Lay rice paper on a plate and begin to assemble your roll.\r\n2)Add lettuce towards the bottom of the rice paper. Leave 1 to 1½ inches of space on either side of the rice paper. Layer with mint and chives. Try to not add too many items because it will be harder to roll and might tear your rice paper.\r\n3)Add shrimp in the middle of the rice paper with the orange skin facing down.\r\n4)Layer the sliced pork on top of the shrimp.\r\n5)Add the noodles across the vegetables, spread evenly across.\r\n6)Fold the left and right sides towards the middle so that it\'s snug. Lay some chives lengthwise with one end poking out. Then fold the bottom up to cover the noodles. You want to keep the roll tight, so lightly squeeze it together as you roll. Continue to roll upwards to complete the spring roll.\r\nPEANUT DIPPING SAUCE:-\r\n1)In a pan over medium heat, saute garlic in oil until fragrant.\r\n2)Add in hoisin sauce, peanut butter, and water and mix thoroughly.\r\n3)Bring to boil, and then immediately turn off the heat and pour into a heat safe dipping bowl.

Please note that cook time does not include time for cooking rice as it varies depending on device/method you use to cook rice. You will need a bamboo sushi mat.\r\nSushi Roll Ingredients:-\r\nTo Prepare the Sushi Rice:-\r\n1)3 rice cooker cups of uncooked short-grain Japanese rice will yield 6⅔ cups of cooked rice and can make 10 Hosomaki (thin sushi rolls). Please follow my Sushi Rice recipe for step-by-step instructions on how to cook the rice and add the sushi seasonings. For this recipe, use 2¼ cups uncooked 2)Japanese short-grain white rice, 2¼ cups water, and 1 piece kombu (dried kelp) to cook the rice.\r\n3)For this recipe, use ⅓ cup rice vinegar (unseasoned), 3 Tbsp sugar, and 1½ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt to season the rice. Cover the sushi rice and the completed rolls with a damp cloth/plastic wrap at all times to prevent from drying.\r\nTo Prepare the Fillings:-\r\n1)Cut both ends of 1 Japanese or Persian cucumber. Then, cut in half lengthwise and cut again in half so you now have 4 strips. Remove the seeds with knife and cut in half lengthwise again. You should end up with 8 cucumber strips.\r\n2)Cut 7 oz sashimi-grade tuna into ¼- to ½-inch slices and then cut into long strips ¼- to ½-inch thick.\r\n3)Take out 1 box natto (fermented soybean) from the container and season with the soy sauce or seasoning that came with the package. Mix everything up until it’s slimy and bubbly.\r\nTo Roll the Sushi:-\r\n1)Make vinegared finger-dipping water (tezu) by combining ¼ cup water and 2 tsp rice vinegar (unseasoned) in a small bowl. Applying this water to your hands prevents rice from sticking to your hands.\r\n2)Cut 5 sheets nori (dried laver seaweed) in half. Even though it may look it, nori sheets are not perfectly square; therefore, cut the longer side of the rectangle in half. Also, nori gets stale easily, so store unused nori in an airtight bag and take out only as much as you need.\r\n3)Place the sushi mat on a working surface. The bamboo strings should go sideways so you can roll them up. And put the nori half sheet on the bamboo mat, with one of nori’s long side close to the back edge of the mat. Leave about 3–4 slats visible on the side nearest to you. The shiny side of nori should face DOWN.\r\n4)Moisten your hand before you touch sushi rice.\r\n5)Using a ½-cup measuring cup, measure ½ cup (80 g) of sushi rice into your hand. This way the amount of rice for each roll is the same and the rolls will be equal size. Make sure to wet the measuring cup so the rice won\'t stick. I know, this is not a “proper” way, but until you can grab a perfect amount of rice each time, this trick will do!\r\n6)Place the sushi rice on the left center of nori. Now spread the rice across the nori, leaving a 1-inch space along the top edge of the nori. Use your right hand to spread the rice toward the right and use your left fingers to keep the rice away from the 1-inch space on the top of the nori.\r\n7)Spread the rice evenly with both fingers, still keeping the 1-inch space on the top. Wet your fingers in dipping water if the rice starts to stick to your fingers.\r\n8)Place the filling of your choice (tuna, cucumber, or natto) at the middle of rice. If your tuna or cucumber is a bit too short, add extra pieces on the end. 9)Hold the filling down using your fingers.\r\n10)With one swift movement, roll the sushi over the filling and land right where the edge of the rice is (see you still see the 1-inch nori space after rolling).\r\n11)Don’t move the sushi mat yet and gently shape and tighten the roll with your fingers from outside of the mat. Shape the sushi roll into square (or round). Then finally lift the sushi mat and rotate the roll once to seal the edge of nori. Again gently squeeze and tighten the roll with your fingers.\r\n12)To cut a sushi roll, wet your knife with a damp towel and cut the roll in half first. You should “push then pull” the knife while cutting through the sushi. Wet the knife again and cut each half roll into 3 pieces. Serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and sushi ginger .', 'j4.jpg', 'https://youtu.be/joweUxpHaqc?si=FNdp4-3W4TcXrF3g'),

Collect the grated ginger and squeeze 1 Tbsp ginger juice. Divide the juice. (Reserve the other half of the juice to marinate the pork later.)\r\n4) Add half of the ginger juice to the sauce bowl. Then, add as much of the leftover grated ginger (optional) as you like to the sauce. My family likes a strong ginger taste, so we add about 2–3 tsp ginger, grated.\r\n5) Next, grate ½ onion until you get 1 Tbsp grated onion with juice. (Use the remaining onion to stir-fry later.)\r\n6) Add the grated onion with juice to the ginger sauce and mix it all together.\r\nTo Prepare the Ingredients:-\r\n1) Cut the rest of the ½ onion into thin slices.\r\n2) Now, prepare ¾ lb thinly sliced pork loin. If your pork slices are thicker than ⅛ inch (3 mm), cut several slits on the connective tissue (the white area) between the meat and fat. Red meat and fat have different elasticities, and they will shrink and expand at different rates as they cook. These slits will allow the pork to stay flat while pan-frying and prevent it from curling up.\r\n3) Sprinkle the other half of the ginger juice and 1 Tbsp sake on the pork slices. Set aside for 5 minutes. Tip: Sake and ginger juice helps to remove the pork‘s gamey odor.\r\n4) When you‘re ready to cook the pork slices, lightly sprinkle them with 1 Tbsp all-purpose flour (plain flour). If your pork slices are paper thin—less than ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick—you do not need to dust with flour. Tip: Dusting with flour prevents the pork from drying up and keeps the juices inside the meat.\r\nTo Cook the Pork:-\r\n1) Preheat a large frying pan over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add 1–2 Tbsp neutral oil. Then, add the pork slices in a single layer, turning them over once the bottom is golden brown. Cook in batches so the meat sears properly; you don‘t want to steam the pork in an overcrowded pan.\r\n2) When the pork is no longer pink, transfer to a plate. Make sure not to overcook the pork at this stage as we will continue to cook it in the sauce later.\r\n3) Once you‘ve removed the pork, add more oil to the pan (especially if your pan is not non-stick) and add the onion slices.\r\n4) Sauté the onion slices on medium heat until golden brown, about 6–8 minutes. When the onion slices are tender and translucent, add the pork back to the pan.\r\n5) Stir the sauce one last time to make sure the sugar is not at the bottom of the bowl and pour it over the pork. Bring the sauce to a simmer and spoon it over the pork for about 2 minutes. Season with freshly ground black pepper to taste (optional).\r\n6) When the sauce has thickened, the Ginger Pork is done.

Rub the mixture together with your fingers to break up the butter, until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.\r\n3) Add the milk slowly, mixing as you add, using enough of the milk to get your dough to come together with no lumps remaining. (Your dough should be quite sticky. If a good consistency is not achieved with the listed amount of milk, continue adding until your dough reaches a good consistency.)\r\n4) Spoon the dough out until a well-floured surface. Generously dust the top of the dough and knead the dough 2-3 times to coat it with flour and smooth the surface. Press the dough into a round that is roughly 1 inch thick.\r\n5) Using a well-floured cookie cutter, cut the dough into 2 inch circles. (Be sure to press the cookie cutter straight down and up.
